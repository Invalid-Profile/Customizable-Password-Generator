# Customizable-Password-Generator
A random string generator where the user can customize: the length, whether they want numbers, letters, symbols or a combinaiton of the three.
It is written in Python 2.7 and will sadly not (yet) run on Python 3.
In testing I have found that the limit to the ammount of characters that can be generated at one time is about 750,000. It is possible to go further, but it takes a very long time to generate.
